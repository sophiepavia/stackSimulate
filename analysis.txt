COP 4530: Homework 3
Complexity Analysis.

My adapater class template uses a vector container to implement a generic Stack.
In my clear function I call on vector's built in clear() function.
This clear() function has a complexity of O(n) because each element is destroyed linearly, 
one by one. N is determined by the number of elements in the vector. 
So therefore the complexity of my clear() function in my generic stack class (using vector) is 
also O(n) because my function is implemented with a single line of code that calls the clear() 
function in the vector class, thus nothing is there to change the complexity.
